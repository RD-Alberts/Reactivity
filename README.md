# ‚öõÔ∏èüéØ Reactivity
A full-stack web app built with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [React 19](https://react.dev/) on the frontend.  

This project is part of a course I‚Äôm following to expand my React skills and see how it‚Äôs used in the community. Backend is in C#, which makes it a fun combo for me to practice both.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This project requires **Node.js 22.14 or higher**.


<br />

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure you have **Node.js v22.14+** installed.

Then run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install -D vite-plugin-mkcert
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**  **vite-plugin-mkcert is used for creating local HTTPS certificates.**.
<br />

## üß† What It Does

You can host an activity or join one. Activities have genres, dates, and other details. Great for testing out full-stack logic with real-world features like filters, calendars, and data fetching.
